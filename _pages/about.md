To whomever decides to peruse this website:

If you are reading this, you have found the archives where I document the projects I have completed. Welcome! Feel free to look around and learn about the topics I keep myself busy with. If you are so inclined, email me with suggestions and corrections - I am always looking to collaborate with someone to build something useful!

Who am I, you ask? I am a student of Business Analytics and Data Mining, with interests in data visualisation, website creation, software development and systems analysis. I am also literate in statistical theory, linear algebra and calculus. And of course zombie films.

Here is a list of the languages I have studied, and thus followers of this website can expect projects to be coded in the following:
- Python
- C++
- C#
- C
- Java
- R
- MATLAB

Fair wishes,
Wickus Bester
